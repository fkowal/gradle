### IDE integration improvements


#### Idea Plugin uses targetCompatibility for each subproject to determine module and project bytecode version

The Gradle 'idea' plugin can generate configuration files allowing a Gradle build to be opened and developed in IntelliJ IDEA.
Previous versions of Gradle did not consider any `targetCompatibility` settings for java projects.
This behavior has been improved, so that the generated IDEA project will have a 'bytecode version' matching the highest targetCompatibility value for all imported subprojects.
For a multi-project Gradle build that contains a mix of targetCompatibility values, the generated IDEA module for a sub-project will include an override for the appropriate 'module bytecode version' where it does not match that of the overall generated IDEA project.


#### Scala support for Intellij IDEA versions 14 and later using 'idea' plugin

Beginning with IntelliJ IDEA version 14 Scala projects are no longer configured using a project facet and instead use a
[Scala SDK](http://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2014/10/30/scala-plugin-update-for-intellij-idea-14-rc-is-out/1/) project library. This affects how the IDEA metadata should be
generated. Using the 'idea' plugin in conjunction with Scala projects for newer IDEA version would cause errors due to the Scala facet being unrecognized. The 'idea' plugin
now by default creates a Scala SDK project library as well as adds this library to all Scala modules. More information can be found in the
[user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/scala_plugin.html#sec:intellij_idea_integration).

This feature was contributed by [Nicklas Bondesson](https://github.com/nicklasbondesson).

### Software model improvements

#### Model data report

The model report can be very verbose by default: for each node of the model, it will show you the types of the properties as well as the rules that created or mutated them. However, you might only want to see the data that the model contains, and only the data, for example to validate your build configuration. In that case, you can now do this by calling `gradle model --format=short`. By default, Gradle still outputs the most complete report, which is equivalent to calling `gradle model --format=full`.

#### Fine grained application of rules

TBD - A new kind of rule method is now available, which can be used to apply additional rules to some target.

This kind of method is annotated with `@Rules`. The first parameter defines a `RuleSource` type to apply, and the second parameter defines the target element to apply the rules to.

Two new annotations have been added:

- `@RuleInput` can be attached to a property of a `RuleSource` to indicate that the property defines an input for all rules on the `RuleSource`.
- `@RuleTarget` can be attached to a property of a `RuleSource` to indicate that the property defines the target for the `RuleSource`.

#### Declaration of local JVM installations

It is now possible to declare the local installations of JVMs (JDK or JRE) in your model. Gradle will probe the declared installations and automatically detect which version, vendor and type of JVM it is. This information can be used to customize your `JavaCompile` tasks, and will subsequently be used by Gradle itself to select the appropriate toolchain when compiling Java sources. More information about this can be found in the “[Java sotfware model section of the userguide](userguide/java_software.html.html)”

### The "scala-library" build init type uses the Zinc compiler by default

When initializing a build with the "scala-library" build init type, the generated build now uses the [Zinc Scala comiler](https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc) by default.
The Zinc compiler provides the benefit of being faster and more efficient than the Ant Scala compiler.

### Test filtering support for Test Suites and (in JUnit) Parameterized Tests

You can use [test filtering](userguide/java_plugin.html#test_filtering) in the Java Plugin to execute a specific subset of tests. Now, you can match against TestSuite names in both JUnit and TestNG test tasks. You can also filter against Parameterized Tests in JUnit test tasks. Try some of the following command-line invocations:

    gradle test --tests "com.example.MyTestSuite"        // Includes the tests in the given suite.
    gradle test --tests "com.example.ParameterizedTest"  // All iterations of methods in the test.
    gradle test --tests "*ParameterizedTest.foo*"        // All iterations of the foo method in the test.
    gradle test --tests "*ParameterizedTest.*[2]"        // Only iteration 2 of all methods in the test.

These same patterns can also be used in the [filter section](userguide/java_plugin.html#testfiltering) of the test task directly in your `build.gradle` file.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to 'idea' plugin Scala projects

Scala projects using the 'idea' plugin now generate IntelliJ IDEA metadata targeting versions 14 and newer. Users of IDEA versions older than 14 will need to update
their build scripts to specify that metadata should be generated for an earlier IDEA version.

    idea {
        targetVersion = '13'
    }


### Change in exclude file pattern matching (May Exclude Fewer!)

Projects which use wildcards in patterns to `exclude` files from certain tasks may notice that fewer files are excluded than in previous versions of Gradle.

For example, if the project had a directory structure like:

    files/ignoreMe.txt
    files/valid/Some.class
    file/alsoValid/Some.Java

And a FileTree configured with a single-level wildcard `('*')`:

    fileTree('files') {
        exclude('*')
    }

In previous versions of Gradle, the FileTree would exclude all files (even those in subdirectories).

This version of Gradle changes the behavior (see: [GRADLE-3182](https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3182)) so that FileTree will exclude only the files in the top-level directory (`files/ignoreMe.txt`) and will contain the files in the subdirectories. This behavior is now consistent with how `include` patterns work.

To reproduce the behavior of earlier releases, change the single-level wildcard to a multi-level wildcard:

    fileTree('files') {
        exclude('**')
    }

### Changes to the experimental software model

TBD: explain the motivation, add more details

The `ComponentSpec` hierarchy has been reorganised.

- The `sources` and `binaries` properties of `ComponentSpec` have been moved to several subtypes.

#### Type registration

- `LanguageTypeBuilder`, `ComponentTypeBuilder`, `BinaryTypeBuilder` replaced by `TypeBuilder`.
- The `languageName` property has been removed from `LanguageTypeBuilder`. This property was not used and does not make sense for `LanguageSourceSet` subtypes that don't represent an actual language.

#### Other changes

- Deprecated properties `ComponentSpec.source` and `BinarySpec.source` have been removed. These were replaced by the `sources` property.
